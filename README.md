# hello-world
Not sure what i'm doing. Super excited to figure it out, though
I am 48 years old. I have 3 children, two of which are studying at IU and one is a sophomore at Center Grove here in Greenwood.  The two olders are learning quite a bit about computer programming and I thought it would be a good idea to learn about it too, for multiple reasons.  Reason one- to further my career. Reason two- to be able to talk "shop" with the kids who can NOT know more than me about these types of things.
